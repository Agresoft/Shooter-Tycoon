Shooter-Tycoon
==============

Another simple clicker game, this is simply a test.

-----------  Version 0.0.2_4  -----------
- A very tiny update, added a limit to the amount of bullets you can have at one time. Sell the bullets to reset the limit back to zero.

-----------  Version 0.0.2_3  -----------    
- Added a button that allows you to sell
all of your current bullets. Each bullet 
is worth $0.25. 
- This was just a short little update
to allow you to sell your bullets. Next 
update (Hopefully) I will allow the 
game to support tabs. These tabs will
hopefully allow for a cleaner looking 
interface and hopefully allow for more 
features to be added in the future!

-----------  Version 0.0.1_1  -----------
- Added a resource folder for all of the 
sprites. Currently only has one sprite,
which is a simple pistol bullet.
- Created a simple window for the game to
play in (1100 by 688 for now)
- Added a button, which uses a unique
pistol bullet sprite,in which, 
when clicked, will add 16 "bullets"
 to your total amount.
Later this while be upgradable.


What's next:

- Will add a capacity in which will limit
the amount of bullets you can store at 
once. 
- Will add the ability to sell bullets 
for money, which will be used for 
upgrading.
- Will add upgrades which will increase
the number of bullets you can create,
will increase your carrying capacity,
and will eventually increase sell price.

-----------  Version 0.0  -----------
   -   Initial commit, this is simply an empty project.
